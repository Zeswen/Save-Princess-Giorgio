# Save Princess Giorgio
Defend the gorgeous princess Giorgio on your adventure and rise upon all enemies!  

You will have to defeat 8 waves of feroceus monsters for 30 seconds, and defeat the giant Demon on the final wave. It'll be hard to accomplish.

But don't worry! You will have the help of Ironhack's TAs to defeat every single monster, they'll give you all the power you need (for a good price, of course).
